            <h2><strong>The Shape of Style</strong></h2>
            <p>
                The Ducati Diavel 1260 Lamborghini was born from the collaboration between two prestigious brands that have their roots in Motor Valley, the land in Emilia-Romagna within which can be found many of the world's most significant companies in the automotive sector, made in a limited and numbered edition of 630 units 

                To carry out this project, Ducati designers chose to be inspired by the Sián FKP 37, the most prestigious car ever made by Lamborghini: available in only 63 units, each of which personalized to specific customer requests, it is a masterpiece of exclusivity, design and innovation. It is inspired by the Countach, has razor-sharp lines, aerodynamic elegance and an unmistakable silhouette. 

                Producing combined thermal and electric power of 819 hp (602 kW), the Sián FKP 37 is the most powerful Lamborghini ever produced.

            <h2>Limited and numbered edition of 630 units</h2>
            <p>
                A motorcycle made in a limited and numbered edition of 630 units and destined to win the hearts of motorcyclists and collectors from all over the world.

                Unconventional, unique, unmistakable. The Diavel is the model of the Ducati range able to amaze enthusiasts with its personality, with the road behaviour of a naked sport thanks to a thoroughbred sports engine and with its design, which has made it an icon of style and ‘Made in Italy’ and for which it has received prestigious international recognition such as the ‘Red Dot Award’ and ‘Good Design Award’.
            </p>
            <h2>Exclusive Livery</h2>
            <p>
                The livery of the Diavel 1260 Lamborghini is the result of the joint work between the Centro Stile Ducati and the Centro Stile Lamborghini. 

                The paints applied to the bike are in fact exactly the same as those used for the Sián FKP 37, with the bodywork characterized by the "Gea Green" colour, while the frame, the undertray and the forged rims are embellished by the use of “Electrum Gold” colour. The typical Ducati Red is recalled by the colouring of the Brembo brake calipers.
