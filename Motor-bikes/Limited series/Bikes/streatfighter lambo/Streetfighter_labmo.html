            <p>
                The second chapter of the collaboration between two brands that have contributed to writing the history of Motor Valley, gives birth to the Ducati Streetfighter V4 Lamborghini, with a dedicated livery and a specially designed dressing to recall the design of the famous Lamborghini Huracán STO (Super Trofeo homologated).

                A motorcycle that perfectly embodies the values of style, sportiness, and exclusivity shared by the two brands with a perfect combination of technology, performance, and design.

            <h2>Inspired by the line of the Huracán STO</h2>
            <p>
                The Huràcan STO is the highest-performing model ever made of the Huracán family, a super sports car created with the sole purpose of offering all the sensations of sports driving and the technology of a real racing car in a model approved for road use.
            </p>
            <p>
                By applying the technical base of the Panigale V4 S '23 and integrating elements that characterize the DNA of Lamborghini, Ducati has created a hyper-exclusive model, inspired by the Huracàn STO.
            </p>
            <p>
                The colors used for the bike are exactly the same as those used for the Huracán STO, with a base in "Citrea Green" and contrasting parts in "Dac Orange."

            <h2>A numbered and limited edition of 630 + 63 units</h2>
            <p>
                The livery of the Ducati Streetfighter V4 Lamborghini was defined through a collaboration between Centro Stile Ducati and Centro Stile Lamborghini.
            </p>
            <p>
                63 is the number that recalls the founding year of the Sant'Agata Bolognese company. 630 constitutes the number of examples to be produced by Ducati, each accompanied by a certificate of authenticity.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, a limited and numbered series of 63 units reserved for special Lamborghini customers who will have the opportunity to customize the bike with body colours and rims identical to the car they own

Essentially, the ABS regulates the braking pressure on the wheel, allowing it to continuously have traction on the riding surface.
